###Â How

Swaggins extracts useful information for your [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) docs from Node.js HTTP `res` object.

### Install

`-g` is optional, you might want to do it for when you
use `swaggins` from the CLI.

`npm install swaggins`

### Usage

Have a look at [the express example](https://github.com/lazywithclass/swaggins/tree/master/examples/express)
but ideally you would have to do the following steps

 * [configure your tests](#configure-your-tests)
 * [run your tests](#run-your-tests), so you get the JSON swagger definition
 * [prepare the docs folder](#prepare-the-docs-folder) with the JSON
 * [serve](#serve) your docs

#### Configure your tests

There are two ways to do so:

 * [`probe`](#probe): proxying Node.js `http.request` once at the top of your test
 * [`extract`](#extract): passing `res` everytime you need

##### probe

Include this line at the top of your test and you're good to go:

```javascript
require('swaggins').probe();
```

It makes sense to include it just once for all your test, it proxies `http.request` so there's no reason to do it twice.

[Example](https://github.com/lazywithclass/swaggins/tree/master/examples/express/test-with-probe.js#L4)

##### extract

Pass `res` only where you need:

```javascript
var extract = require('swaggins').extract;

it('answers to /answer with 42', function(done) {
  request(
    'http://localhost:3000/answer/everything',
    function cb(err, res, body) {
      extract(res); <--- here is where we use swaggins
      expect(body).to.equal('42');
      done();
    }
  );
});
```

[Example](https://github.com/lazywithclass/swaggins/blob/master/examples/express/test-with-extract.js#L12)

#### Run your tests

In the examples folder I've provided a [very basic example](https://github.com/lazywithclass/swaggins/blob/master/examples/express/run-me.sh),
Swaggins expects you to run your integration tests against
a real server, so that it can get `res` and extract the information.

#### Prepare the docs folder

At this point I assume you have the JSON definition, so just run

```bash
$ swaggins doc
```

to get your JSON definition and swagger-ui in `docs/`.

#### Serve

Show your API docs

```bash
$ swaggins serve [port]
```

This will run the server on port 8080, if you want to change that just pass the port as argument

```bash
$ swaggins serve 3000 
```
